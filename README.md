Most of the code comes from: https://github.com/westlinkin/AndroidLocalizationer. 
But it is not updated for a long time, a lot of bugs, so I changed its project, I hope everyone together to maintain.
 
Differences to AndroidLocalizationer:
 
 * I only joined Google Translate Because i like google. Secondly I think Google Translate is better than Microsoft Translate
 
 * But Google translation need to apply api key, the key can try 365 days. You can go [google translate api](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/getting-started)
 
 * Change the list to 3 columns to avoid blocking the language below
 
 * Add all selected features
 
 * I fixed some bugs.
